# Visual-Odometry
Requirements:
opencv-3.0 
numpy

In this project, there is more than 10 features extraction methods that are be tested 
with their combination to achieve to a best result in different external conditions.

For testing the project, only change the dataset path and the paths for saving results and put into your terminal:
python Code.py

the main dataset used in this project is the KITTI- dataset, it is a open-source and useful dataset.
Also, for testing and comparing the different Features extraction, detection and matching methods, other 
datasets are used where they contain several images which differ by point of view, brightness, noise ratio, dark light,...
these datasets can be found in the datasets.zip file.
